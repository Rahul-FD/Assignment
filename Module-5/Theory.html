    <b>1.What are the new tags added in HTML5?</b><br><br>
    <b>Ans.</b><br><br>
    <b>HTML5 introduced several new tags compared to previous versions of HTML. Some of the notable new tags added in HTML5 include:</b><br>
        <b>1.&lt;header&gt;: Defines a header for a document or section.</b><br>
        <b>2.&lt;nav&gt;: Defines a container for navigation links.</b><br>
        <b>3.&lt;article&gt;: Represents an independent piece of content within a document, such as a blog post or news article.</b><br>
        <b>4.&lt;section&gt;: Defines a section of a document, often used in conjunction with the &lt;article&gt; tag.</b><br>
        <b>5.&lt;aside&gt;: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, such as sidebars or pull quotes.</b><br>
        <b>6.&lt;footer&gt;: Defines a footer for a document or section.</b><br>
        <b>7.&lt;main&gt;: Specifies the main content of a document, excluding headers, footers, and navigation.</b><br>
        <b>8.&lt;figure&gt;: Represents self-contained content, such as images, diagrams, or code snippets, with an optional caption provided by the &lt;figcaption&gt; tag.</b><br>
        <b>9.&lt;figcaption&gt;: Provides a caption or description for content within a &lt;figure&gt; element.</b></b><br><br>
        <b>These are just some of the key additions introduced in HTML5. There are other new elements and attributes as well, which collectively aim to enhance the structure, semantics, and functionality of web documents.</b><br><br>

    <b>2.How to embed audio and video in a webpage?</b><br><br>
    <b>Ans.</b><br><br>
    <b>To embed audio and video in a webpage using HTML5, you can use the &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements, respectively. Here's how you can do it:</b><br><br>
        <li>Audio</li><br><br>
            <b>1.&lt;audio&gt;: This is the container element for embedding audio content.</b><br>
            <b>2.controls: This attribute adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the audio player.</b><br>
            <b>3.&lt;source&gt;: This element specifies the audio file to be played and its type.</b><br>
            <b>4.src: Specifies the URL of the audio file.</b><br>
            <b>5.type: Specifies the MIME type of the audio file.</b><br><br><br>
        <li>Vedio</li><br><br>
            <b>1.&lt;video&gt;: This is the container element for embedding video content.</b><br>
            <b>2.controls: This attribute adds playback controls (play, pause, volume, etc.) to the video player.</b><br>
            <b>3.width and height: These attributes specify the dimensions of the video player.</b><br>
            <b>4.&lt;source&gt;: This element specifies the video file to be played and its type.</b><br>
            <b>5.src: Specifies the URL of the video file.</b><br>
            <b>6.type: Specifies the MIME type of the video file.</b><br><br>

    <b>3.Semantic element in HTML5?</b><br><br>
    <b>Ans.</b><br><br>
    <b>Semantic elements in HTML5 are elements that carry meaning and convey the structure of the content, rather than just being presentational. They provide a clearer indication of the purpose or function of the content they contain. Using semantic elements properly can improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and the overall organization of a webpage. Some of the semantic elements introduced in HTML5 include:</b><br>
        <b>1.&lt;header&gt;: Represents introductory content typically at the top of a page or section, often containing headings, logos, navigation, etc.</b><br>
        <b>2.&lt;nav&gt;: Defines a container for navigation links within a webpage.</b><br>
        <b>3.&lt;section&gt;: Represents a thematic grouping of content within a document, such as chapters, headings, or groups of related content.</b><br>
        <b>4.&lt;article&gt;: Represents an independent, self-contained piece of content that can be distributed and reused independently from the rest of the document, such as a blog post or news article.</b><br>
        <b>5.&lt;aside&gt;: Represents content that is tangentially related to the content around it, often used for sidebars or additional information.</b><br>
        <b>6.&lt;footer&gt;: Represents a footer for a section or the whole document, typically containing copyright information, contact details, or links to related resources.</b><br>
        <b>7.&lt;main&gt;: Defines the main content of a document, excluding headers, footers, and navigation.</b><br>
        <b>Using these semantic elements appropriately helps both developers and browsers understand the structure and meaning of a webpage's content, leading to better accessibility, maintainability, and search engine ranking.</b><br><br>

    <b>4.Canvas and SVG tags.</b><br><br>
    <b>Ans.</b><br><br>
    <b>&lt;canvas&gt; Element:</b><br>
        <b>The &lt;canvas&gt; element is a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which means it is essentially a rectangular area where you can draw graphics using JavaScript. It's suitable for rendering dynamic and interactive graphics, such as games, data visualization, or complex animations.</b><br><br>    
    <b>&lt;svg&gt; Element:</b><br>
        <b>SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format that allows you to define graphics using XML syntax. It's resolution-independent and ideal for creating static or dynamic graphics that can be scaled without losing quality. SVG is well-suited for diagrams, logos, icons, and other scalable graphics.</b><br><br>
